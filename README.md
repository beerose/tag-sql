Build sql queries for mysqljs in a safe and comfortable way ðŸ’¥

---

**sql-tag** allows to pass query parameters directly to the query string.
It's the alternative for parametrized queries.

```js
const userId = 1;
sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId};`;
```

It'll be converted to the the object of type `QueryOptions` that is accepted by **mysqljs**.

```js
{
  sql: SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?;,
  values: [userId],
}
```
